### ESLint

To ensure code quality, the `ESLint` was used in this project.
So the code will be available with good development practices, being more readable and easy to maintain!

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:
